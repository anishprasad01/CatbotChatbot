# CatbotChatbot
A simple bot created to learn the basics of the Microsoft Bot Framework. It is the result of about 4 days of work with no prior experience with the SDK or the Bing Maps API.

* Currently, the bot will ask the user a list of questions to gauge their ideal cat, and then use those response to create a list of browser web searches that the user might find helpful to learn about cats.
* It can also accept the user's location and show a few nearby cat shelters on a map using the Bing Maps API.
* Lastly, it can search for cat pictures and videos in your browser, because of course it can. How could anyone make anything cat related without it?!
* 
This bot is written in C# and uses the Microsoft Bot Framework. Example code from the Bot Framework documentation is also used. The bot is deployed on Azure using Azure Bot Service with CI/CD from this repository to Azure.
